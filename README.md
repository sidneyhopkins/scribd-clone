# Scribd Clone

#### By Sidney Hopkins

#### A clone of the Scribd landing page.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS (modules), Sass, JavaScript, React, Material-UI, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, Netlify

## Description

This is a recreation of the [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/) landing page. Scribd is an e-book and audiobook subscription service with over one million titles. **All of the images and logos belong to Scribd Inc.**

The intention of this project was to match or improve upon the landing page user experience. I used an image scrapping tool to gather digital assets from the webpage. In most cases, the page components aesthetically match the original. However, I made modifications to improve the user experience.

Modifications:

- The links all point to this github repository / [return to the clone ->](https://sidney-scribd-clone.netlify.app)
- The page is responsive on more screen sizes
- The icons are from Material-UI and look slightly different

#### Ongoing Development and Learning

- Introducing the Jest testing library as I learn it
- Refactoring the code to include Sass mixins
